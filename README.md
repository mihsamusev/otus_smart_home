14 homeworks are organized into branches:

- [x] [`homework1`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/otus_smart_home/tree/homework1) - Smart home prototype of 2 devices: socket and termometer
- [x] [`homework2`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/otus_smart_home/tree/homework2) - Smart home layout and device info providers
- [x] [`homework3`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/otus_smart_home/tree/homework3) - Smart home library split into modules and covered by tests
- [x] [`homework4`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/otus_smart_home/tree/homework4) - Custom errors and exception flow is added to the library
- [x] [`homework5`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/otus_smart_home/tree/homework5) - Library is refactored so that the smart home owns all device entities instead of keeping track of their id.
- [x] [`homework6`](https://github.com/mihsamusev/otus_smart_home/tree/homework6) - Smart socket can be interacted with by TCP

# Examples for this submission

Example of network communication between smart socket and smart home

```sh
cargo run --example net_socket_emulator # start a TCP server for a smart socket that is listenning for commands

# can be run together with 2 client options, normal and interactive
cargo run --example net_home # non-interactive client
cargo run --example net_home_interactive # interactive home client
```

In addition example from previous submissions

```sh
cargo run --example mock_devices # run exaple of report generation of non-networked smart device mocks
```
